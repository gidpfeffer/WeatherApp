# WeatherApp

## Background
This app is the first Swift application I have ever built with any real utility associated with it. It was the first time I scraped web data in a swift app, and the first time I had to handle checking user input for potential invalid inputs. The Picture for the app background was taken by **Thomas Oettinger** and was accessed through [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search). For people downloading the swift files, the photo can be found in WeatherApp/WeatherApp/thomas-oettinger-2770.jpg.

## Course
The project was taken from a Udemy Intro to App Development course. More information on the course can be found at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/complete-ios-10-developer-course/learn/v4/content)
